# arXiv Bibliographic Explorer

**Collaborator:** Matt Bierbaum, Cornell Computer & Information Science

[<i class="fa fa-github"></i> https://github.com/mattbierbaum/arxiv-bib-overlay](https://github.com/mattbierbaum/arxiv-bib-overlay).

The arXiv bibliographic overlay displays information about works that cite and
are cited by arXiv papers and their published versions. The primary objective
of the project is to enable discovery of relevant research and context by
providing user-friendly navigation of an article's citation tree. These types
of navigational tools are available within many journal interfaces and 3rd
party tools (Google Scholar, ADS, Inspire, etc) and provide immense value for
researchers.

In this project, we wish to provide similar functionality for arXiv users: to
navigate the citation tree within the arXiv corpus as well as to external
resources including journals, bibliographic databases, and citation database
tools. Providing links to cited references in arXiv e-prints was identified for
development under the [2017 arXiv
Roadmap](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/arxivpub/2017+arXiv+Roadmap),
based on input from the [arXiv user survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08212).

The main goals which we wish to cover are:

- Listing known references and citations for a given article with comprehensive
  metadata (authors, year, journal, etc).
- Provide filtering and viewing tools on arXiv abstract pages to enable easy
  access to parts of the citation tree.
- Facilitate navigation to these articles within arXiv, to external journals,
  and to bibliographic databases as appropriate (as measured by community
  engagement).
- Provide tools to export article metadata in formats usable by bibliographic
  tools.
